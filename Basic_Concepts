# Simple Operations
# math rules apply so its -5 not -9
print(-2-1*3)


# Floats
# computers can't store the calculated values of fractions perfectly

# Other Numerical Operations
# exponentiation
print(2**3)
# floor division calculates the quotient
print(20//6)
# modulo calculates the remainder
print(20 % 6)
